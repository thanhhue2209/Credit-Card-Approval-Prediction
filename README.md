# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
In this project, i will build an automatic prediction engine for credit card approval using machine learning technology. I used these models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classification, Random Forest Classification, Support Vector Machine Classification and XGBoost Classification.

To help everyone observe and understand the data easily, i use 3 types of graphs: Pie chart, bar chart and distribution graphs with showing the percentage of values for each variable on the figure.
